## 💡 About

**DenoHost** allows you to seamlessly run [Deno](https://deno.com/) scripts or
inline JavaScript/TypeScript code within your .NET applications.\
It bundles platform-specific Deno executables as separate NuGet packages and
provides a simple, consistent API for execution.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 Modular runtime packages (per RID)
- 🛠️ Clean .NET API with async execution
- 🧪 Testable with xUnit
- 📦 Packaged for NuGet (multi-target)
- 🐧 Linux, 🪟 Windows, 🍎 macOS support

## Deno.Execute Example

For simple script execution with immediate results:

```csharp
using DenoHost.Core;

var options = new DenoExecuteBaseOptions { WorkingDirectory = "./scripts" };
string[] args = ["run", "app.ts"];

await Deno.Execute(options, args);
```

## DenoProcess Example

For long-running processes with interactive communication:

```csharp
using DenoHost.Core;

// Create a managed Deno process
using var denoProcess = new DenoProcess(
  command: "run",
  args: ["--allow-read", "server.ts"],
  workingDirectory: "./scripts"
);

// Start the process
await denoProcess.StartAsync();

// Send input to the process
await denoProcess.SendInputAsync("hello");

// Stop gracefully when done
await denoProcess.StopAsync();
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- .NET 9.0+
- Deno version is bundled per RID via GitHub Releases
- No need to install Deno globally
